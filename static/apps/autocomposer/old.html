      This is a prototype for a program that automatically writes music. Click the "Help" button to get started.<br>

    <h2>Hiccups</h2>
    <p>This is a work in progress, so you may spot some weird behaviour here and there. For the best experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use this on desktop. It's being developed and tested for Google Chrome right now.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You'll want to keep the chord progressions short. According to my numbers from the
          <a href="test/index.html" target="_blank">test page</a>, the app will attempt to generate around 390,000
          melodies if you give it 8 three-note chords. If you give it 8 four-note chords, it'll try to generate around 3.7 million melodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happens if you enter way too many chords? You'll just see your browser slow to a crawl. :)
