# About Me

I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada. Having worked in tech since 2014, I'm comfortable with using many types of software tools to build a proper solution. In addition, I tend to work well with designers and artists when collaborating on visuals. When I'm away from work, I'm usually playing music (bass/cello/guitar) or hanging out at a climbing gym.
