# About Me

Hi, my name is RJ and a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada. Having worked in web development since 2014, I've learned how to use several technologies to tackle issues across tech stacks. As my career progressed, I developed a focus on the front-end, UI/UX, data visualization, and 3D modeling. More recently, I've worked with complex data visualizations in a research project (Uncharted Software) and 2D/3D construction estimation (Autodesk Construction Solutions).

Nowdays, I'm setting my sights on emerging digital tools in AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction). Historically, my family has strong ties in this line of work. My grandfather was an aircraft mechanic, and his cousin founded a construction company. That company built my childhood home, which my father designed. I've always had an interest in architecture, and during the pandemic I took college courses for Architecture Tech. I hope to leverage tech to efficiently and sustainably improve our built environment.

When I'm away from work, I'm usually playing music or hanging out at a climbing gym. I'm an avid musician and love playing guitar (flamenco), bass (jazz/rnb), and cello (classical). My tunes can be found on Instagram at [@salvadorrjams](https://www.instagram.com/salvadorrjams/)
