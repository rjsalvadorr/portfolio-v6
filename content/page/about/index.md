# About Me

When I’m away from work, I’m usually playing music, climbing at a gym, or designing more things. In general, I'm chasing things that I'm curious about.

## Some life goals

- Build up repertoire on guitar, start performing music again
- Design my own house and have it built
- Make a career designing and building cool things (buildings, art, machines, whatever)
