- Has first-hand experience with most stages of the SDLC, from kickoff, to delivery, to maintenance. Has leveraged that experience for various business contexts, such as understanding technical feasibility or helping plan project roadmaps.
- Proficient at implementing UI designs to spec and solving UX problems. Has a strong understanding of design/UX processes and methods (Figma, Illustrator). Works well with designers, having grown up with artists while studying art until college.

## Technical Experience

### Senior Associate (Experience Technology), Publicis Sapient

_May 2022 -- Sep 2022  
Toronto, Canada  
Core technologies -- React, Next.js, Nx, Typescript, Storybook, AEM_

- As part of the kick-off dev team, helped lay the technical foundations of a forward-looking app for a leading healthcare provider. These foundations allowed for rapid component development even while dependent design system assets lagged in delivery.

### Software Engineer, Uncharted Software

_Nov 2019 -- Apr 2021  
Toronto, Canada  
Core technologies -- Ember.js, Cytoscape, Node.js, Express, Python, AWS_
 
- Worked on a research project featuring a network graph visualization that helped uncover insights in complex scenarios.
- Responsible for integrating a graph analysis module built by researchers at Virginia Tech. This module described a modeled scenario with natural language, which gave users another way to interpret complex data.
- Reworked front-end components to improve visuals and performance. This aligned the UI closer to the company design system, and reduced UX jankiness while rendering more visual data.

### UI Web Developer, Intelex Technologies

_Jun 2017 -- Feb 2019  
Toronto, Canada  
Core technologies -- React, .NET, SQL Server, Jenkins_ 

- Helped build a new React.js UI for an existing legacy app for the EHSQ industry, allowing health and safety professionals to share industry knowledge and show new ways to use familiar Intelex tools.
- Gradually focused more on improving code quality standards as the codebase grew. Was part of a front-end working group that released guidelines for code style and structure, which proved useful for future refactoring.

### Technical Developer, Jonah Group

_Sep 2014 -- Nov 2016  
Toronto, Canada  
Core technologies -- jQuery, Java/J2EE, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, Oracle 11g, Jenkins_

- Built webpages that allowed car dealers to do their customers' credit applications online. This linked their users directly to a system with 18,000+ dealerships with 1,400+ finance sources.
- Ensured that webpages conformed to the responsive visual specs. This allowed our app to be usable on several browsers and device types.
