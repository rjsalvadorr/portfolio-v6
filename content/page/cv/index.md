## Skills and Qualifications

- Experienced with several web development platforms and frameworks, having worked for five years in front-end roles (React, Ember), plus two years in full-stack roles (J2EE, .NET, Python). Accustomed to navigating complex codebases and learning unfamiliar tools quickly.
- Proficient at implementing UI designs to spec and solving UX problems. Has a strong understanding of design/UX processes, methods (Figma, Illustrator), and design systems.
- Has first-hand experience with most stages of the software development lifecycle, from kickoff, to delivery, to maintenance. Has leveraged that experience to understand technical feasibility and help plan project roadmaps.

Core technologies -- React, Node.js, Revit, ADSK Construction Cloud/BIM360, ADSK Viewer/Forge/LMV_

- Worked in the team behind Autodesk Takeoff, a web-based takeoff and estimation tool for 2D sheets and 3D models. Takeoff is part of Autodesk Construction Cloud, a platform of apps for managing a building's design, construction, and operation.
- Focused on improving the app's UX through implementing new functionality, reworking existing elements, or refactoring "under the hood".
- Leveraged in-house component libraries to build new UI modules. Collaborated with design system experts to keep implementation consistent with the rest of the platform.

Core technologies -- Ember.js, Cytoscape, Node.js, Express, Python, AWS_
 
- Worked on Causeworks, a research project featuring a network graph visualization that helped uncover insights in complex scenarios.
- Integrated a graph analysis module built by researchers at Virginia Tech. This module described a modeled scenario with natural language, giving users another way to interpret complex data.
- Reworked front-end components to improve visuals and performance. This aligned the UI closer to the company design system, reduced UX jankiness, and rendered more visual data.

### UI Web Developer, Intelex Technologies

_Jun 2017 -- Feb 2019  
Toronto, Canada  
Core technologies -- React, .NET, SQL Server, Jenkins_ 

- Helped build a new React UI on a legacy app for the EHSQ industry. This allowed health and safety professionals to share industry knowledge about using Intelex tools.
- Gradually focused on improving code quality standards as the codebase grew. Was part of a front-end working group that released guidelines for code style and structure, which proved useful for future refactoring.

### Technical Developer, Jonah Group
