Hi, my name is RJ and I'm inquiring about available software roles in your organization. If your organization needs help with front-end engineering, then I believe my skills and experience can help you.

Having worked in web development for six years, I have hands on experience with several tools and frameworks (mostly JavaScript, Python, Java). Across different projects, I have first-hand experience of most stages of the SDLC (kickoff, deployment, maintenance). During that time, I've learned to work effectively with non-technical and technical colleagues, especially design and UX teams. I've had a strong interest in visual arts since high school and I'm familiar with design tools, techniques, and methods.

My experience and skills make me a good fit for front-end engineering roles or a role involving UI/UX and data visualization. While I'm strong with UI work, I'm not fazed by doing back-end work when necessary. Regardless of where I work on the stack, I aim to work against a high standard. As my career continues, I intend to specialize further in data-viz and 3D content on the web.

If your organization can use a developer with my skills, I'd be happy to discuss further. Please check my resume for more detailed info (attached, or accessible on my homepage below).

Sincerely,  
RJ Salvador
