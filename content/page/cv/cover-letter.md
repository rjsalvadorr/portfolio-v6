Hi, my name is RJ and I'm inquiring about available software roles in your organization. If your organization is looking for a web developer, I believe my skills and experience can help your team build quality tech.

Having been in the web-dev business for six years, I have hands on experience using several frameworks and languages (mostly JavaScript, Python, Java). In addition, I have first-hand experience of most stages of the SDLC (kickoff, deployment, maintenance). During that time, I've learned how to work and communicate with key stakeholders and colleagues, particularly with UI/UX teams. I've had a strong interest in visual arts since high school and I'm familiar with design tools, techniques, and methods.

My experience should make me a good fit for a front-end developer role or any work involving UI/UX and data visualization. While I'm strong with UI work, I'm not fazed by doing back-end work if necessary. Regardless, I aim to do any coding to a high standard. As my career continues, I aim to specialize further in data-viz and 3D content on the web.

If your organization can use a developer with my skills, I'd be happy to discuss further. Please check my resume for more detailed info (attached, or accessible on my homepage below).

Sincerely,  
RJ Salvador
